# Test-Driven Development

## What is test driven development?

Test Driven Development (TDD) is software development approach in which test cases are developed to specify and validate what the code will do. In simple terms, test cases for each functionality are created and tested first and if the test fails then the new code is written in order to pass the test and making code simple and bug-free.

Test-Driven development is a process of developing and running automated test before actual development of the application. Hence, TDD sometimes also called as Test First Development.

## How to perform TDD test

Following steps define how to perform TDD test,

1.Add a test.
2.Run all tests and see if any new test fails.
3.Write some code.
4.Run tests and Refactor code.
5.Repeat.

## TDD cycle defines:

1.Write a test
2.Make it run.
3.Change the code to make it right i.e. Refactor.
4Repeat process.
